The safety content is being developed to help teach about the different types of tools and machines we have around the shop, and how they can be used safely.

Each machine has a page about what it is and it's uses. This is followed by a Safety Information Sheet which details some basic safety notes for using the it, and if available a Standard Operating Procedure that should be followed whenever it is used. These resources are taken from the [Ontario College for Technology Education](https://octe.ca/) (OCTE)'s safety publications designed for use in high schools.

After reading through the safety material, you can complete a fill-in-the-blank quiz to show you've learned it. **These quizzes must be completed before you can use the machines**. You don't have to do them for every machine, but you can't use a specific machine until you've passed and submitted it's quiz.

Remember that this training is just the first step, focusing on making sure you know the basics needed to safely work around the machines. **You still need supervision and permission** to actually work on any of the machines, even after completing the quizzes.

We're still in the process of rolling out resources for the full set of machines in the shop. Check back every so often to see which new machines are available.
