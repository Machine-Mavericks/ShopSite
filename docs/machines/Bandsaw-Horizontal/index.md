The horizontal bandsaw is an incredibly useful machine for cutting long thin stock to length.

It has a large saw blade that runs through a moving head, with a small bit exposed for cutting. Material is clamped in a vice, and the head is slowly dropped onto stock held in the vice by hydraulic pressure. This makes for a very accurate cut, while not needing to push the stock through by hand.

The Horizontal Bandsaw has the blade running side/side, not to be confused with the [Vertical Bandsaw](../Bandsaw/index.md) (or just Bandsaw) which runs up/down.
