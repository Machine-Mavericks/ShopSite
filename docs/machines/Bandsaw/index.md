The bandsaw is an incredibly useful machine for cutting material to size.

It has a large saw blade that runs through the machine, with a small bit exposed for cutting. The Vertical Bandsaw (or just Bandsaw) has the blade running up/down, not to be confused with the side/side Horizontal Bandsaw.

In the shop we have two bandsaws: One has larger teeth and is better for cutting wood or thicker materials. The other as smaller teeth, and is better for cutting metals and thin materials. Using the right one is important, since you could wear out the blades, damage your stock, or possibly get hurt.
