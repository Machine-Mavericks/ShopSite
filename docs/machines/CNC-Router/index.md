CNC Routers are used to cut shapes out of raw material. We use them mostly for cutting parts out of plywood, polycarbonate/Lexan, and aluminium.

In the shop we have two CNC Routers, the ~2x2.5' OMIO CNC and the 4x4' Laguna CNC. The two machines are quite different and will require separate training for actual use, but the general safety notes are the same.
