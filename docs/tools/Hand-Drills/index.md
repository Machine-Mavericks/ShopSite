Drills are the most common tools we use around the shop.

They can be used for a range of jobs, from drilling holes to driving screws to spinning prototypes.

This covers both drills and impact drivers. While they appear similar, the impact driver is designed specifically for driving screws with extra force, while the drill is better for general use.
