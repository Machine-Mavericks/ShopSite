The OCTE SAFEDocs are the the foundation for the resources on this website. The Safety Information Sheets and Quizzes are extracted from them.
Standard operating procedures are also taken from OCTE, but are found separately on [their website](https://octe.ca/resources/safety).

The primary source is the 2022 revision of the Manufacturing SAFEDoc, as it's most relevant to what we do.
For machines not covered in Manufacturing, the 2022 Construction/Custom Woodworking SAFEDoc then 2022 Technological Design documents are used.

If you'd like to learn about more machines and procedural elements, feel free to give the SAFEDocs a read.
